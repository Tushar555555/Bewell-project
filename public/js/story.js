var story1 = "A boy named John was upset. His father found him crying. When his father asked John why he was crying, he said that he had a lot of problems in his life.His father simply smiled and asked him to get a potato, an egg, and some coffee beans. He placed them in three bowls.He then asked John to feel their texture and then fill each bowl with water. John did as he had been told. His father then boiled all three bowls. Once the bowls had cooled down, John’s father asked him to feel the texture of the different food items again.John noticed that the potato had become soft and its skin was peeling off easily; the egg had become harder and tougher; the coffee beans had completely changed and filled the bowl of water with aroma and flavour.Moral of the story. Life will always have problems and pressures, like the boiling water in the story. It’s how you respond and react to these problems that counts the most!"

var story2 = "Once, a group of frogs was roaming around the forest in search of water. Suddenly, two frogs in the group accidentally fell into a deep pit. The other frogs worried about their friends in the pit. Seeing how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that there was no way they could escape the deep pit and that there was no point in trying. They continued to constantly discourage them as the two frogs tried to jump out of the pit. But keep falling back. Soon, one of the two frogs started to believe the other frogs — that they’ll never be able to escape the pit and eventually died after giving up. The other frog keeps trying and eventually jumps so high that he escapes the pit. The other frogs were shocked at this and wondered how he did it. The difference was that the second frog was deaf and couldn’t hear the discouragement of the group. He simply thought they were cheering him on! Moral of the story. People’s opinion of you will affect you, only if you believe it to be so. It’s better to believe in yourself."

var story3 = "This popular story is about a hare (an animal belonging to the rabbit family), which is known to move quickly and a tortoise, which is known to move slower. The story began when the hare who has won many races proposed a race with the tortoise. The hare simply wanted to prove that he was the best and have the satisfaction of beating him. The tortoise agreed and the race began.The hare got a head-start but became overconfident towards the end of the race. His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while. And so, he took a nap right near the finish line.Meanwhile, the tortoise walked slowly but extremely determined and dedicated. He did not give up for a second and kept persevering despite the odds not being in his favour. While the hare was asleep, the tortoise crossed the finish line and won the race! The best part was that the tortoise did not gloat or put the hare down! Moral of the story.Slow and steady wins the race. When you work hard, stay focused, you can achieve anything, even when it seems impossible."

In her excitement, she forgot about the pails she was carrying and began to skip.Suddenly, she realised that the milk was spilling down and when she checked her pails, they were empty.Moral of the story.

One day, a man visiting the circus asked the ringmaster: “Why haven’t these elephants broken the rope and run away?”The ringmaster replied: “From when they were young, the elephants were made to believe that they were not strong enough to break the ropes and escape.” It was because of this belief that they did not even try to break the ropes now. Moral of the story Don’t give in to the limitations of society. Believe that you can achieve everything you want to!"
